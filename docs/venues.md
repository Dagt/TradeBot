## Exchange configuration

Per-venue settings such as maker/taker fees or tick sizes can be defined in
`config/config.yaml` under an ``exchange_configs`` section:

```yaml
exchange_configs:
  binance_spot:
    market_type: spot
    maker_fee_bps: 10.0
    taker_fee_bps: 10.0
    tick_size: 0.01
```

Venues without an explicit entry fall back to automatic ``_spot``/``_perp``
inference for the market type.
